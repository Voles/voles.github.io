On July 2nd, ECMA published the press release [announcing ECMAScript&reg; 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm). I’ve been experimenting with some of the new features of the language.

Because most of the new featured aren't supported by most browsers, the ES6 code must be transpiled to ES5 compatible code. There are a couple of tools out there which can do the job. 

**My setup consists of:**

- [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) &mdash; to compile the ES26 code to ES5 code
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) &mdash; to run the webserver and trigger the compile task

The [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Voles/es6-traceur-gulp) contains all source code, including documentation.

I'll describe some of the new features I've tried and think are worth sharing.

## New String features

### Methods
New methods like `startsWith()` and `includes()` provide a much more natural to work with strings.
They are  more readable than doing the same checks using `indexOf()`.

Note that these methods are case sensitive, as [I found out while experimenting](https://github.com/Voles/es6-traceur-gulp/blob/master/app/main.js#L12).

### Multiline strings
It is now possible to use multiline strings, without having to concatenate each line.

{% codeblock lang:js %}`This is
valid ES2015`
{% endcodeblock %} 

### String interpolation
Instead of concatenating strings and variables, code can be more readable using string interpolation. Note that the backticks are required here.

{% codeblock lang:js %}var theAnswer = 42;
`The answer is ${theAnswer}`
{% endcodeblock %}

## Functions

### Named parameters
Functions can now take named parameters, which can have default values.
When you execute the `doGreeting()` function below without passing a value, it’s default output will be `Hi!`

{% codeblock lang:js %}
function doGreeting(greeting = ‘Hi!’) {
    console.log(greeting);
}
{% endcodeblock %}

### Arrow functions
It’s now also possible to use *Arrow Functions*. This is basically a new syntax to write functions, with a [few differences](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/#leanpub-auto-arrow-functions).

The example code below defines function `sayIt`, which takes one parameter `it`.

{% codeblock lang:js %}
var sayIt = it => console.log(it);
sayIt('Yo');
{% endcodeblock %}

I’ve worked with Python before, where terms as list comprehension and generators are commonly used.
Good news, generators are now part of ECMAScript 6!

A simple example is the `alphabetGenerator()`.

{% codeblock lang:js %}
function *alphabetGenerator() {
    yield 'A';
      yield 'B';
        yield 'C';
}
{% endcodeblock %}

A working example can be found on line 54 of my [ES6 experiments](https://github.com/Voles/es6-traceur-gulp/blob/master/app/main.js#L54).

## Deploying ES6 code

The code generated by Traceur depends on a small runtime library containing Javascript code for things like creating classes, handling spread arguments, etc. 

There is not yet a 'One Size Fits All' solution to compile all code during the build process.
Dr. Axel Rauschmayer has written a great overview on [how to deploy ECMAScript 6 code](http://www.2ality.com/2015/04/deploying-es6.html).
