Since I've started using Vim to configure EC2 instances, I can't get enough of it.
This post will be my personal cheat sheet, to document the commands I use on a regular base.

### Vim commands

* __L__  
	go to the start of the current line

* __gg__  
	go to the beginning of the current file

* __dd__  
	remove the current line

* __$__  
	jump to the end of the current line
