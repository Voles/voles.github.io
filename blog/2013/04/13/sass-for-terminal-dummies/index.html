<p>A while ago, there were some posts on <a title="Forrst" href="http://www.forrst.com" target="_blank">Forrst</a> about LESS. <a title="Less" href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Less</a> is a tool, made to add extra functionality to CSS. Until now I only wrote ‘static’ CSS-files, sometimes with over 500 lines of code. To make the stylesheet more readable, I grouped codeblocks, used comments, added extra indent with tabs, etc.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Splitting up the stylesheet in separate files is also an option to keep everything structured, but that adds a lot of extra HTTP-request.</p>

<p>Recently, one of our teachers told us about Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass). <a title="Sass" href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> is more or less the same as LESS, the main difference is that LESS uses the CSS syntax and Sass uses its own syntax. But it’s possible to use CSS-syntax with <a title="scss" href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html" target="_blank">SCSS</a>.</p>

<p>I was (and still am :-)) very excited about it, and I&#8217;d like to share my experience / knowledge with the rest of the world.</p>

<h3>What is Sass?</h3>


<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 13.0px Georgia; color: #0a0a0a} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} span.s2 {text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px color: #1022a3} -->


<p><em>“Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding <a href="http://sass-lang.com/#nesting">nested rules</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/#variables">variables</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/#mixins">mixins</a>,<a href="http://sass-lang.com/#extend">selector inheritance</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html">more</a>. It’s translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.”
</em> I have nothing more to add, this is what Sass stands for (from <a title="sass-lang" href="http://www.sass-lang.com" target="_blank">sass-lang.com</a>).</p>

<h3>Compass</h3>


<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->


<p>One of the disadvantages of pure CSS was that if you import other CSS-files, you create extra HTTP-requests. Compass is a framework that makes it possible to compile all your imported CSS-files into one CSS-file. I think there is no reasen why you wouldn’t use Compass if you work with Sass.</p>

<h3>Using Sass</h3>


<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} span.Apple-tab-span {white-space:pre} -->


<p>To use Sass first create two new folders ‘css’ and ‘sass’. In the same directory, create a file named ‘config.rb’. Add these lines to the file:</p>

<pre lang="css">css_dir = “css”
sass_dir = “sass”
output_style = :compressed</pre>


<p><em>Make sure that you replace the double quotes with these (&#8220;) when you copy-paste this code. Else you will get compile errors, because of invalid characters.</em></p>

<p>The first line refers to the directory were your final CSS-file will be compiled to. The seconds line tells where your .scss-files are stored.</p>

<p>The last line tells the compiler to compress the final CSS-file, so you will save some bandwith (wich is important for mobile-applications).</p>

<p>Now make a file named ‘screen.scss’ in the directory ‘sass/’. Here you can write CSS-code like you did before.</p>

<p>Now we first have to install Sass and Compass. Type these two commands in the Terminal, to install both Ruby Gems.</p>

<pre lang="css">$ sudo gem install haml
$ sudo gem install compass</pre>


<p>To compile the file, we use Terminal. Now we have to go to the folder ‘sass’ we just created, via Terminal. To change the current directory, type the command ‘cd’ and then   the path you want to go to. E.g. ‘cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/my-first-sass-project’.</p>

<p>Next, we have to compile the ‘screen.scss-file’. We will compile the file using Compass. Use the commando ‘compass compile sass/screen.scss’ to compile your scss-file.</p>

<p>Now look at your ‘css-folder’. There should be a file named ‘screen.css’, with your previously written CSS-code, compressed.</p>

<p>That’s it. If you don’t want to manually compile the .scss-file after you saved it, you can use the commando ‘watch’. Use ‘compass watch sass/screen.scss’ to automatically compile your sass-file when you make some changes (and save the file).</p>

<p>Sass offers some great build-in functions for <a title="color-manipulations" href="http://nex-3.com/posts/89-powerful-color-manipulation-with-sass" target="_blank">color-manipulations</a>, be sure to check it out if you want to learn more about it.</p>

<h3>Sass functions</h3>


<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->


<p><strong>Variables
</strong>You can declare variables and use them everywhere in your .scss-file. This can come in handy when you wan to use the same colors over and over again for e.g. headings, links, menu&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Nesting
</strong>You can write much cleaner CSS-code with this. Code example:</p>

<pre lang="css">ul.message {
  li.warning {
    color: yellow;
  }

  li.error {
    color: red;
  }

  li.success {
    color: green;
  }
}</pre>


<p><strong>Mixins</strong>
Mixins are like functions. You can pass some parameters and it gives you the result you want. Code example:</p>

<pre lang="css">@makebox ($background, $border, $width) {
  background: $background;
  border: 1px solid $border;
  width: $width;
}</pre>


<pre lang="css">#boxA {
  @include makebox(#FF0000, #000000, 150);
}

#boxB {
  @include makebox(#00FF00, #CCCCCC, 375);
}</pre>


<p><strong>Inheritance</strong>
It is possible to extend selectors from other selectors. Code example:</p>

<pre lang="css">.blue {
  background: #0000FF;
  border: 10px dashed #0000FF;
}</pre>


<pre lang="css">#box {
  @extend .blue;
  width: 160px;
}</pre>


<p>If you like what you see, be sure to take a look at these resources to learn Sass. The most complicated part is installing / compiling the files. Most other things speak for themselves.</p>
