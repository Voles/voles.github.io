    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Basic setup</h2>

<p>First we have to create a new project in <strong>Flash Builder</strong>, go to <em>File</em> <strong>→</strong> <em>New</em> <strong>→</strong> <em>ActionScript Project</em>.</p>

<p>You will see a dialog where you can fill in your project details. Fill in your <em>Project name</em> and press the <em>Next</em> button.</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/project-name.png &lsquo;Project name&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Change the <em>Main application file</em> to <em>Main.as</em>, this is just a convention. Press finish to complete your project setup.</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/main-application-file.png &lsquo;Main application file&rsquo; %}</p>

<h2>Flash Library</h2>

<p>Now, the only thing we have is an empty AS3-project. We can use Flash Builder to write our classes etc., but most projects will need some graphics. Thats where the Flash IDE comes in.</p>

<p>Make a new .fla-file and make a MovieClip with a very basic drawing in it. Go to the properties of the MovieClip.</p>

<p>Tick <em>Export for ActionScript</em> and change the classname (‘Class’) to &lsquo;SimpleShape’. You schould have something like this:</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/mc-properties.png &lsquo;MovieClip properties&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Because we want to use the library of this .fla-file with Flash Builder, we have to make a .swc-file. You can learn more about .swc-files in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340866/what-is-a-flash-swc-file-and-how-is-it-used" title="Stackoverflow question, what is swc and how is it used">Stackoverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>To let your .fla-file generate a .swc-file, go to <em>File</em> <strong>→</strong> <em>Publish Settings</em>. Next, go to the <em>Flash</em>-tab and thick <em>Export SWC</em>.</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/publish-settings.png &lsquo;Publish settings&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Press the <em>OK</em>-button. Every time you change something in your .swf-file, you will have to publish your .swc-file again to make sure it contains the latest updates of your library. You can generate a .swc-file with the shortcut <em>command + return</em>.</p>

<h2>Link the SWC to your Flash Builder project</h2>

<p>Go back to Flash Builder and make a new folder named ‘libs’ in your project. Here you can put all your resources for the project. The structure of your project should look like this:</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/project-structure.png &lsquo;Project structure&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Go back to the Flash IDE and save your .fla-file in the folder <em>libs</em> you have just created in your Flash Builder project. The location of your project depends on your workspace in Flash Builder.</p>

<p>Save the .fla-file as <em>library.fla</em> and again create a .swc-file (<em>command + return</em>). Go back to Flash Builder and your project structure now should look like this:</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/libs-folder.png &lsquo;Libs folder&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Now we must let the project know that he can use the .swc-files in the <em>libs</em>-folder. Right-click on the name of the project, go to <em>Properties</em>. Go to the <em>ActionScript Build Path</em>-tab and then to the <em>Library path</em>-view. Click <em>Add SWC Folder</em> and select your <em>libs</em>-folder. You should see this:</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/build-path.png &lsquo;Actionscript build path&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Now your .swc-file is linked with your Flash Builder project, click <em>Ok</em>.</p>

<h2>Preloader</h2>

<p>We have a very small .swc-file, with only one MovieClip. But when you have lots and lots of graphics, MovieClips and sound, your .swc-file will soon become bigger. When your .swf-file is loading all these data, we want to give the user some feedback. We can do this by making a preloader.</p>

<p>In the constructor of your Main.as, add these lines of code:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:as3 %}
// stage
stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;
stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;</p>

<p>if (loaderInfo.bytesLoaded > loaderInfo.bytesTotal)
{
    // swf is already loaded
    preloaderCompleteHandler(null);
}
else
{
    // preloader methods
    loaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, preloaderCompleteHandler);
    loaderInfo.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, preloaderProgressHandler);
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>We look at the loaderInfo of the SWF tho check if all data is loaded. If not, we add two eventlisteners to the loaderInfo. Next, add these functions to the Main-class:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:as3 %}
/<em>*
 * Preloader progress
 </em>/
private function preloaderProgressHandler(event:ProgressEvent):void
{
    trace(&ldquo;Preloader progress: &rdquo; + Math.round((event.bytesLoaded / event.bytesTotal) * 100) + &ldquo;%&rdquo;);
}</p>

<p>/<em>*
 * Preloader complete
 </em>/
private function preloaderCompleteHandler(event:Event):void
{</p>

<p>}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The progress-function contains some simple math to trace the progress of the preloader. You can also use this value so visualise the progress.</p>

<p>Now we have to write the preloaderCompleteHandler, but first a little more info about preloaders and Flash.</p>

<p>When the SWF is loading, it will not play until every classe you have used on the first frame is loaded. So we will add a second frame to the Flash Builder project, where you can use as much classes as you want. On the first frame, we will use as little classes as possible.</p>

<p>This way, the SWF will show the first frame (where we will show a preloader), and when everything is loaded, we jump to the second frame.</p>

<p>To make this work, we first have to make a second class, I name it ‘Application.as’ and put it in a package named ‘be.devine’.</p>

<p>Again, right click on your Flash Builder project and go to ‘Properties’. In the ‘ActionScript Compiler’-tab, put this in the ‘Additional compiler arguments’: “-frame &ldquo;start&rdquo; be.devine.Application”. This creates a second frame for your project. You should have this:</p>

<p>{% img /images/posts/compiler-arguments.png &lsquo;Additional compiler arguments&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>Go to your Main.as class and change the superclass to ‘MovieClip’ instead of Sprite. You have to do this because we want multiple frames (one frame for the preloader and a second frame for the application itself) and a Sprite doesn’t have a timeline.</p>

<p>The last thing we have to write is the preloaderCompleteHandler. Add these lines to the function:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:as3 %}
// go to second frame
gotoAndStop(&ldquo;start&rdquo;);</p>

<p>// application classname
var applicationClass:* = getDefinitionByName(&ldquo;be.devine.Application&rdquo;);</p>

<p>// make the application
var application:* = new applicationClass();
addChild(application);
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>You see I’ve used the asterisk, this is used like a ‘joker’. So the ‘application’ variable can be any class, but is doesn’t make a explicit reference to the Application-class. This makes sure the that the SWF will not wait until the Application-class is loaded before showing up the preloader.</p>

<h2>Testing the preloader</h2>

<p>To make sure the preloader is working properly, I’ve added a big image (3.8 MB) in the Application-class.</p>

<p>When you debug the project, you will see a lot of traces with the current status of te preloader, when the application is loaded, the Application-class will trace “Hello World”.</p>

<h2>Source files</h2>

<p>You can download <a href="/downloads/MyFirstActionscriptProject.zip">the example project</a> and play around with it.</p>

<p>I hope you learned something from this. Please, do not hesitate to comment with your opinion, doubts, feedback&hellip;</p>
